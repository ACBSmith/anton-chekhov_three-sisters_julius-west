			<p>The old garden at the house of the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Prosorovs</b>. There is a long avenue of firs, at the end of which the river can be seen. There is a forest on the far side of the river. On the right is the terrace of the house: bottles and tumblers are on a table here; it is evident that champagne has just been drunk. It is midday. Every now and again passersby walk across the garden, from the road to the river; five soldiers go past rapidly.</p>

He was at school with me; he was expelled from the fifth class of the High School for being entirely unable to understand <i>ut consecutivum</i>. He’s awfully hard up now and in very poor health, and when I meet him I say to him, “How do you do, <i>ut consecutivum</i>.” “Yes,” he says, “precisely <i>consecutivum</i>⁠ ⁠…” and coughs. But I’ve been successful all my life, I’m happy, and I even have a Stanislaus Cross, of the second class, and now I myself teach others that <i>ut consecutivum</i>.
