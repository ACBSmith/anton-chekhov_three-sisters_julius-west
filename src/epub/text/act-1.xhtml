        [In PROSOROV’S house. A sitting-room with pillars; behind is seen a
        large dining-room. It is midday, the sun is shining brightly outside. In
        the dining-room the table is being laid for lunch.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl’s high
        school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black
        dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white,
        stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. It’s just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your
        name-day, Irina. It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would
        never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has gone
        by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are
        wearing a white dress and your face is happy. [Clock strikes twelve] And
        the clock struck just the same way then. [Pause] I remember that there
        was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He
        was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present.
        Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Why think about it!
      </p>
      <p>
        [BARON TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the
        dining-room, behind the pillars.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. It’s so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the
        birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade,
        and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly
        that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering
        then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years
        have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday.
        Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring,
        joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. Will you take a bet on it?
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Oh, nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        [MASHA, lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Don’t whistle, Masha. How can you! [Pause] I’m always having
        headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach
        till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old
        woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working
        here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have
        been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and
        gains in strength...
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. To go away to Moscow. To sell the house, drop everything here,
        and go to Moscow...
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Yes! To Moscow, and as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        [CHEBUTIKIN and TUZENBACH laugh.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. I expect Andrey will become a professor, but still, he won’t want
        to live here. Only poor Masha must go on living here.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Masha can come to Moscow every year, for the whole summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        [MASHA is whistling gently.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Everything will be arranged, please God. [Looks out of the
        window] It’s nice out to-day. I don’t know why I’m so happy: I
        remembered this morning that it was my name-day, and I suddenly felt
        glad and remembered my childhood, when mother was still with us. What
        beautiful thoughts I had, what thoughts!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. You’re all radiance to-day, I’ve never seen you look so lovely.
        And Masha is pretty, too. Andrey wouldn’t be bad-looking, if he wasn’t
        so stout; it does spoil his appearance. But I’ve grown old and very
        thin, I suppose it’s because I get angry with the girls at school.
        To-day I’m free. I’m at home. I haven’t got a headache, and I feel
        younger than I was yesterday. I’m only twenty-eight.... All’s well, God
        is everywhere, but it seems to me that if only I were married and could
        stay at home all day, it would be even better. [Pause] I should love my
        husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. [To SOLENI] I’m tired of listening to the rot you talk.
        [Entering the sitting-room] I forgot to say that Vershinin, our new
        lieutenant-colonel of artillery, is coming to see us to-day. [Sits down
        to the piano.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. That’s good. I’m glad.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Is he old?
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Oh, no. Forty or forty-five, at the very outside. [Plays
        softly] He seems rather a good sort. He’s certainly no fool, only he
        likes to hear himself speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Is he interesting?
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Oh, he’s all right, but there’s his wife, his mother-in-law,
        and two daughters. This is his second wife. He pays calls and tells
        everybody that he’s got a wife and two daughters. He’ll tell you so
        here. The wife isn’t all there, she does her hair like a flapper and
        gushes extremely. She talks philosophy and tries to commit suicide every
        now and again, apparently in order to annoy her husband. I should have
        left her long ago, but he bears up patiently, and just grumbles.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. [Enters with CHEBUTIKIN from the dining-room] With one hand I
        can only lift fifty-four pounds, but with both hands I can lift 180, or
        even 200 pounds. From this I conclude that two men are not twice as
        strong as one, but three times, perhaps even more....
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Reads a newspaper as he walks] If your hair is coming
        out... take an ounce of naphthaline and hail a bottle of spirit...
        dissolve and use daily.... [Makes a note in his pocket diary] When found
        make a note of! Not that I want it though.... [Crosses it out] It
        doesn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. What does my own little girl want?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch! I feel as if I were
        sailing under the broad blue sky with great white birds around me. Why
        is that? Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Kisses her hands, tenderly] My white bird....
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. When I woke up to-day and got up and dressed myself, I suddenly
        began to feel as if everything in this life was open to me, and that I
        knew how I must live. Dear Ivan Romanovitch, I know everything. A man
        must work, toil in the sweat of his brow, whoever he may be, for that is
        the meaning and object of his life, his happiness, his enthusiasm. How
        fine it is to be a workman who gets up at daybreak and breaks stones in
        the street, or a shepherd, or a schoolmaster, who teaches children, or
        an engine-driver on the railway.... My God, let alone a man, it’s better
        to be an ox, or just a horse, so long as it can work, than a young woman
        who wakes up at twelve o’clock, has her coffee in bed, and then spends
        two hours dressing.... Oh it’s awful! Sometimes when it’s hot, your
        thirst can be just as tiresome as my need for work. And if I don’t get
        up early in future and work, Ivan Romanovitch, then you may refuse me
        your friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Tenderly] I’ll refuse, I’ll refuse....
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven
        and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks
        so serious! [Laughs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. You’re so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer
        to you when my face is serious. I’m twenty!
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. How well I can understand that craving for work, oh God! I’ve
        never worked once in my life. I was born in Petersburg, a chilly, lazy
        place, in a family which never knew what work or worry meant. I remember
        that when I used to come home from my regiment, a footman used to have
        to pull off my boots while I fidgeted and my mother looked on in
        adoration and wondered why other people didn’t see me in the same light.
        They shielded me from work; but only just in time! A new age is dawning,
        the people are marching on us all, a powerful, health-giving storm is
        gathering, it is drawing near, soon it will be upon us and it will drive
        away laziness, indifference, the prejudice against labour, and rotten
        dullness from our society. I shall work, and in twenty-five or thirty
        years, every man will have to work. Every one!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. I shan’t work.
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. You don’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. In twenty-five years’ time, we shall all be dead, thank the
        Lord. In two or three years’ time apoplexy will carry you off, or else
        I’ll blow your brains out, my pet. [Takes a scent-bottle out of his
        pocket and sprinkles his chest and hands.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Laughs] It’s quite true, I never have worked. After I came
        down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I
        just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket]
        Here we are.... I’ve learnt from the papers that there used to be one,
        Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his
        career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics of
        Russia], for instance, but what he wrote—I don’t know... God only
        knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There....
        They’re calling me downstairs, somebody’s come to see me. I’ll be back
        in a minute... won’t be long.... [Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. He’s up to something.
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Yes, he looked so pleased as he went out that I’m pretty
        certain he’ll bring you a present in a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. How unpleasant!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Yes, it’s awful. He’s always doing silly things.
      </p>
      MASHA.
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        “There stands a green oak by the sea.
        And a chain of bright gold is around it...
        And a chain of bright gold is around it....”
 </pre>
      <p>
        [Gets up and sings softly.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. You’re not very bright to-day, Masha. [MASHA sings, putting on her
        hat] Where are you off to?
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. Home.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. That’s odd....
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. On a name-day, too!
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. It doesn’t matter. I’ll come in the evening. Good-bye, dear.
        [Kisses MASHA] Many happy returns, though I’ve said it before. In the
        old days when father was alive, every time we had a name-day, thirty or
        forty officers used to come, and there was lots of noise and fun, and
        to-day there’s only a man and a half, and it’s as quiet as a desert...
        I’m off... I’ve got the hump to-day, and am not at all cheerful, so
        don’t you mind me. [Laughs through her tears] We’ll have a talk later
        on, but good-bye for the present, my dear; I’ll go somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. [Displeased] You are queer....
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. [Crying] I understand you, Masha.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. When a man talks philosophy, well, it is philosophy or at any
        rate sophistry; but when a woman, or two women, talk philosophy—it’s
        all my eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. What do you mean by that, you very awful man?
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. Oh, nothing. You came down on me before I could say... help!
        [Pause.]
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. [Angrily, to OLGA] Don’t cry!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter ANFISA and FERAPONT with a cake.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ANFISA. This way, my dear. Come in, your feet are clean. [To IRINA] From
        the District Council, from Mihail Ivanitch Protopopov... a cake.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Thank you. Please thank him. [Takes the cake.]
      </p>
      <p>
        FERAPONT. What?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. [Louder] Please thank him.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Give him a pie, nurse. Ferapont, go, she’ll give you a pie.
      </p>
      <p>
        FERAPONT. What?
      </p>
      <p>
        ANFISA. Come on, gran’fer, Ferapont Spiridonitch. Come on. [Exeunt.]
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. I don’t like this Mihail Potapitch or Ivanitch, Protopopov. We
        oughtn’t to invite him here.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. I never asked him.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. That’s all right.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter CHEBUTIKIN followed by a soldier with a silver samovar; there is
        a rumble of dissatisfied surprise.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. [Covers her face with her hands] A samovar! That’s awful! [Exit
        into the dining-room, to the table.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. My dear Ivan Romanovitch, what are you doing!
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. [Laughs] I told you so!
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. Ivan Romanovitch, you are simply shameless!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. My dear good girl, you are the only thing, and the dearest
        thing I have in the world. I’ll soon be sixty. I’m an old man, a lonely
        worthless old man. The only good thing in me is my love for you, and if
        it hadn’t been for that, I would have been dead long ago.... [To IRINA]
        My dear little girl, I’ve known you since the day of your birth, I’ve
        carried you in my arms... I loved your dead mother....
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. But your presents are so expensive!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Angrily, through his tears] Expensive presents.... You
        really, are!... [To the orderly] Take the samovar in there.... [Teasing]
        Expensive presents!
      </p>
      <p>
        [The orderly goes into the dining-room with the samovar.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ANFISA. [Enters and crosses stage] My dear, there’s a strange Colonel
        come! He’s taken off his coat already. Children, he’s coming here. Irina
        darling, you’ll be a nice and polite little girl, won’t you.... Should
        have lunched a long time ago.... Oh, Lord.... [Exit.]
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. It must be Vershinin. [Enter VERSHININ] Lieutenant-Colonel
        Vershinin!
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [To MASHA and IRINA] I have the honour to introduce myself,
        my name is Vershinin. I am very glad indeed to be able to come at last.
        How you’ve grown! Oh! oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Please sit down. We’re very glad you’ve come.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [Gaily] I am glad, very glad! But there are three sisters,
        surely. I remember—three little girls. I forget your faces, but
        your father, Colonel Prosorov, used to have three little girls, I
        remember that perfectly, I saw them with my own eyes. How time does fly!
        Oh, dear, how it flies!
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. From Moscow? Are you from Moscow?
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Yes, that’s so. Your father used to be in charge of a battery
        there, and I was an officer in the same brigade. [To MASHA] I seem to
        remember your face a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. I don’t remember you.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Olga! Olga! [Shouts into the dining-room] Olga! Come along! [OLGA
        enters from the dining-room] Lieutenant Colonel Vershinin comes from
        Moscow, as it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. I take it that you are Olga Sergeyevna, the eldest, and that
        you are Maria... and you are Irina, the youngest....
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. So you come from Moscow?
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Yes. I went to school in Moscow and began my service there; I
        was there for a long time until at last I got my battery and moved over
        here, as you see. I don’t really remember you, I only remember that
        there used to be three sisters. I remember your father well; I have only
        to shut my eyes to see him as he was. I used to come to your house in
        Moscow....
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. I used to think I remembered everybody, but...
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. My name is Alexander Ignateyevitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Alexander Ignateyevitch, you’ve come from Moscow. That is really
        quite a surprise!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. We are going to live there, you see.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. We think we may be there this autumn. It’s our native town, we
        were born there. In Old Basmanni Road.... [They both laugh for joy.]
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. We’ve unexpectedly met a fellow countryman. [Briskly] I remember:
        Do you remember, Olga, they used to speak at home of a “lovelorn Major.”
         You were only a Lieutenant then, and in love with somebody, but for some
        reason they always called you a Major for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [Laughs] That’s it... the lovelorn Major, that’s got it!
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. You only wore moustaches then. You have grown older! [Through her
        tears] You have grown older!
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Yes, when they used to call me the lovelorn Major, I was
        young and in love. I’ve grown out of both now.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. But you haven’t a single white hair yet. You’re older, but you’re
        not yet old.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. I’m forty-two, anyway. Have you been away from Moscow long?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Eleven years. What are you crying for, Masha, you little fool....
        [Crying] And I’m crying too.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. It’s all right. And where did you live?
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Old Basmanni Road.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Same as we.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Once I used to live in German Street. That was when the Red
        Barracks were my headquarters. There’s an ugly bridge in between, where
        the water rushes underneath. One gets melancholy when one is alone
        there. [Pause] Here the river is so wide and fine! It’s a splendid
        river!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Yes, but it’s so cold. It’s very cold here, and the midges....
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. What are you saying! Here you’ve got such a fine healthy
        Russian climate. You’ve a forest, a river... and birches. Dear, modest
        birches, I like them more than any other tree. It’s good to live here.
        Only it’s odd that the railway station should be thirteen miles away....
        Nobody knows why.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. I know why. [All look at him] Because if it was near it wouldn’t
        be far off, and if it’s far off, it can’t be near. [An awkward pause.]
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Funny man.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Now I know who you are. I remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. I used to know your mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. She was a good woman, rest her soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Mother is buried in Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. At the Novo-Devichi Cemetery.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. Do you know, I’m beginning to forget her face. We’ll be forgotten
        in just the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Yes, they’ll forget us. It’s our fate, it can’t be helped. A
        time will come when everything that seems serious, significant, or very
        important to us will be forgotten, or considered trivial. [Pause] And
        the curious thing is that we can’t possibly find out what will come to
        be regarded as great and important, and what will be feeble, or silly.
        Didn’t the discoveries of Copernicus, or Columbus, say, seem unnecessary
        and ludicrous at first, while wasn’t it thought that some rubbish
        written by a fool, held all the truth? And it may so happen that our
        present existence, with which we are so satisfied, will in time appear
        strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Who knows? But on the other hand, they may call our life
        noble and honour its memory. We’ve abolished torture and capital
        punishment, we live in security, but how much suffering there is still!
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. [In a feeble voice] There, there.... The Baron will go without
        his dinner if you only let him talk philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Vassili Vassilevitch, kindly leave me alone. [Changes his
        chair] You’re very dull, you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. [Feebly] There, there, there.
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. [To VERSHININ] The sufferings we see to-day—there are
        so many of them!—still indicate a certain moral improvement in
        society.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Yes, yes, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. You said just now, Baron, that they may call our life noble;
        but we are very petty.... [Stands up] See how little I am. [Violin
        played behind.]
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. That’s Andrey playing—our brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. He’s the learned member of the family. I expect he will be a
        professor some day. Father was a soldier, but his son chose an academic
        career for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. That was father’s wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. We ragged him to-day. We think he’s a little in love.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. To a local lady. She will probably come here to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. You should see the way she dresses! Quite prettily, quite
        fashionably too, but so badly! Some queer bright yellow skirt with a
        wretched little fringe and a red bodice. And such a complexion! Andrey
        isn’t in love. After all he has taste, he’s simply making fun of us. I
        heard yesterday that she was going to marry Protopopov, the chairman of
        the Local Council. That would do her nicely.... [At the side door]
        Andrey, come here! Just for a minute, dear! [Enter ANDREY.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. My brother, Andrey Sergeyevitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. My name is Vershinin.
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. Mine is Prosorov. [Wipes his perspiring hands] You’ve come to
        take charge of the battery?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Just think, Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. That’s all right. Now my little sisters won’t give you any rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. I’ve already managed to bore your sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Just look what a nice little photograph frame Andrey gave me
        to-day. [Shows it] He made it himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [Looks at the frame and does not know what to say] Yes....
        It’s a thing that...
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. And he made that frame there, on the piano as well. [Andrey waves
        his hand and walks away.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. He’s got a degree, and plays the violin, and cuts all sorts of
        things out of wood, and is really a domestic Admirable Crichton. Don’t
        go away, Andrey! He’s got into a habit of always going away. Come here!
      </p>
      <p>
        [MASHA and IRINA take his arms and laughingly lead him back.]
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. Come on, come on!
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. Please leave me alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. You are funny. Alexander Ignateyevitch used to be called the
        lovelorn Major, but he never minded.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Not the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. I’d like to call you the lovelorn fiddler!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Or the lovelorn professor!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. He’s in love! little Andrey is in love!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. [Applauds] Bravo, Bravo! Encore! Little Andrey is in love.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Goes up behind ANDREY and takes him round the waist with
        both arms] Nature only brought us into the world that we should love!
        [Roars with laughter, then sits down and reads a newspaper which he
        takes out of his pocket.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. That’s enough, quite enough.... [Wipes his face] I couldn’t
        sleep all night and now I can’t quite find my feet, so to speak. I read
        until four o’clock, then tried to sleep, but nothing happened. I thought
        about one thing and another, and then it dawned and the sun crawled into
        my bedroom. This summer, while I’m here, I want to translate a book from
        the English....
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Do you read English?
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. Yes father, rest his soul, educated us almost violently. It may
        seem funny and silly, but it’s nevertheless true, that after his death I
        began to fill out and get rounder, as if my body had had some great
        pressure taken off it. Thanks to father, my sisters and I know French,
        German, and English, and Irina knows Italian as well. But we paid dearly
        for it all!
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. A knowledge of three languages is an unnecessary luxury in this
        town. It isn’t even a luxury but a sort of useless extra, like a sixth
        finger. We know a lot too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Well, I say! [Laughs] You know a lot too much! I don’t think
        there can really be a town so dull and stupid as to have no place for a
        clever, cultured person. Let us suppose even that among the hundred
        thousand inhabitants of this backward and uneducated town, there are
        only three persons like yourself. It stands to reason that you won’t be
        able to conquer that dark mob around you; little by little as you grow
        older you will be bound to give way and lose yourselves in this crowd of
        a hundred thousand human beings; their life will suck you up in itself,
        but still, you won’t disappear having influenced nobody; later on,
        others like you will come, perhaps six of them, then twelve, and so on,
        until at last your sort will be in the majority. In two or three hundred
        years’ time life on this earth will be unimaginably beautiful and
        wonderful. Mankind needs such a life, and if it is not ours to-day then
        we must look ahead for it, wait, think, prepare for it. We must see and
        know more than our fathers and grandfathers saw and knew. [Laughs] And
        you complain that you know too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. [Takes off her hat] I’ll stay to lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. [Sighs] Yes, all that ought to be written down.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ANDREY has gone out quietly.]
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. You say that many years later on, life on this earth will be
        beautiful and wonderful. That’s true. But to share in it now, even
        though at a distance, we must prepare by work....
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [Gets up] Yes. What a lot of flowers you have. [Looks round]
        It’s a beautiful flat. I envy you! I’ve spent my whole life in rooms
        with two chairs, one sofa, and fires which always smoke. I’ve never had
        flowers like these in my life.... [Rubs his hands] Well, well!
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Yes, we must work. You are probably thinking to yourself: the
        German lets himself go. But I assure you I’m a Russian, I can’t even
        speak German. My father belonged to the Orthodox Church.... [Pause.]
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [Walks about the stage] I often wonder: suppose we could
        begin life over again, knowing what we were doing? Suppose we could use
        one life, already ended, as a sort of rough draft for another? I think
        that every one of us would try, more than anything else, not to repeat
        himself, at the very least he would rearrange his manner of life, he
        would make sure of rooms like these, with flowers and light... I have a
        wife and two daughters, my wife’s health is delicate and so on and so
        on, and if I had to begin life all over again I would not marry.... No,
        no!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter KULIGIN in a regulation jacket.]
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. [Going up to IRINA] Dear sister, allow me to congratulate you
        on the day sacred to your good angel and to wish you, sincerely and from
        the bottom of my heart, good health and all that one can wish for a girl
        of your years. And then let me offer you this book as a present. [Gives
        it to her] It is the history of our High School during the last fifty
        years, written by myself. The book is worthless, and written because I
        had nothing to do, but read it all the same. Good day, gentlemen! [To
        VERSHININ] My name is Kuligin, I am a master of the local High School.
        [Note: He adds that he is a <i>Nadvorny Sovetnik</i> (almost the same as
        a German <i>Hofrat</i>), an undistinguished civilian title with no
        English equivalent.] [To IRINA] In this book you will find a list of all
        those who have taken the full course at our High School during these
        fifty years. <i>Feci quod potui, faciant meliora potentes</i>. [Kisses
        MASHA.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. But you gave me one of these at Easter.
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. [Laughs] I couldn’t have, surely! You’d better give it back to
        me in that case, or else give it to the Colonel. Take it, Colonel.
        You’ll read it some day when you’re bored.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. Thank you. [Prepares to go] I am extremely happy to have made
        the acquaintance of...
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Must you go? No, not yet?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. You’ll stop and have lunch with us. Please do.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Yes, please!
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. [Bows] I seem to have dropped in on your name-day. Forgive
        me, I didn’t know, and I didn’t offer you my congratulations. [Goes with
        OLGA into the dining-room.]
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. To-day is Sunday, the day of rest, so let us rest and rejoice,
        each in a manner compatible with his age and disposition. The carpets
        will have to be taken up for the summer and put away till the winter...
        Persian powder or naphthaline.... The Romans were healthy because they
        knew both how to work and how to rest, they had <i>mens sana in corpore
        sano</i>. Their life ran along certain recognized patterns. Our director
        says: “The chief thing about each life is its pattern. Whoever loses his
        pattern is lost himself”—and it’s just the same in our daily life.
        [Takes MASHA by the waist, laughing] Masha loves me. My wife loves me.
        And you ought to put the window curtains away with the carpets.... I’m
        feeling awfully pleased with life to-day. Masha, we’ve got to be at the
        director’s at four. They’re getting up a walk for the pedagogues and
        their families.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. I shan’t go.
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. [Hurt] My dear Masha, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. I’ll tell you later.... [Angrily] All right, I’ll go, only please
        stand back.... [Steps away.]
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. And then we’re to spend the evening at the director’s. In spite
        of his ill-health that man tries, above everything else, to be sociable.
        A splendid, illuminating personality. A wonderful man. After yesterday’s
        committee he said to me: “I’m tired, Feodor Ilitch, I’m tired!” [Looks
        at the clock, then at his watch] Your clock is seven minutes fast.
        “Yes,” he said, “I’m tired.” [Violin played off.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. Let’s go and have lunch! There’s to be a masterpiece of baking!
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. Oh my dear Olga, my dear. Yesterday I was working till eleven
        o’clock at night, and got awfully tired. To-day I’m quite happy. [Goes
        into dining-room] My dear...
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Puts his paper into his pocket, and combs his beard] A pie?
        Splendid!
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. [Severely to CHEBUTIKIN] Only mind; you’re not to drink anything
        to-day. Do you hear? It’s bad for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. Oh, that’s all right. I haven’t been drunk for two years.
        And it’s all the same, anyway!
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. You’re not to dare to drink, all the same. [Angrily, but so that
        her husband should not hear] Another dull evening at the Director’s,
        confound it!
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. I shouldn’t go if I were you.... It’s quite simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. Don’t go.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. Yes, “don’t go....” It’s a cursed, unbearable life.... [Goes into
        dining-room.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. [Follows her] It’s not so bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. [Going into the dining-room] There, there, there....
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. Vassili Vassilevitch, that’s enough. Be quiet!
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. There, there, there....
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. [Gaily] Your health, Colonel! I’m a pedagogue and not quite at
        home here. I’m Masha’s husband.... She’s a good sort, a very good sort.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. I’ll have some of this black vodka.... [Drinks] Your health!
        [To OLGA] I’m very comfortable here!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Only IRINA and TUZENBACH are now left in the sitting-room.]
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Masha’s out of sorts to-day. She married when she was eighteen,
        when he seemed to her the wisest of men. And now it’s different. He’s
        the kindest man, but not the wisest.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. [Impatiently] Andrey, when are you coming?
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. [Off] One minute. [Enters and goes to the table.]
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. What are you thinking about?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. I don’t like this Soleni of yours and I’m afraid of him. He only
        says silly things.
      </p>
      <p>
        TUZENBACH. He’s a queer man. I’m sorry for him, though he vexes me. I
        think he’s shy. When there are just the two of us he’s quite all right
        and very good company; when other people are about he’s rough and
        hectoring. Don’t let’s go in, let them have their meal without us. Let
        me stay with you. What are you thinking of? [Pause] You’re twenty. I’m
        not yet thirty. How many years are there left to us, with their long,
        long lines of days, filled with my love for you....
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Nicolai Lvovitch, don’t speak to me of love.
      </p>

        TUZENBACH. [Does not hear] I’ve a great thirst for life, struggle, and
        work, and this thirst has united with my love for you, Irina, and you’re
        so beautiful, and life seems so beautiful to me! What are you thinking
        about?
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. You say that life is beautiful. Yes, if only it seems so! The
        life of us three hasn’t been beautiful yet; it has been stifling us as
        if it was weeds... I’m crying. I oughtn’t.... [Dries her tears, smiles]
        We must work, work. That is why we are unhappy and look at the world so
        sadly; we don’t know what work is. Our parents despised work....
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter NATALIA IVANOVA; she wears a pink dress and a green sash.]
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. They’re already at lunch... I’m late... [Carefully examines
        herself in a mirror, and puts herself straight] I think my hair’s done
        all right.... [Sees IRINA] Dear Irina Sergeyevna, I congratulate you!
        [Kisses her firmly and at length] You’ve so many visitors, I’m really
        ashamed.... How do you do, Baron!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. [Enters from dining-room] Here’s Natalia Ivanovna. How are you,
        dear! [They kiss.]
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. Happy returns. I’m awfully shy, you’ve so many people here.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. All our friends. [Frightened, in an undertone] You’re wearing a
        green sash! My dear, you shouldn’t!
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. Is it a sign of anything?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. No, it simply doesn’t go well... and it looks so queer.
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. [In a tearful voice] Yes? But it isn’t really green, it’s too
        dull for that. [Goes into dining-room with OLGA.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [They have all sat down to lunch in the dining-room, the sitting-room is
        empty.]
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. I wish you a nice fiancée, Irina. It’s quite time you married.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. Natalia Ivanovna, I wish you the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. Natalia Ivanovna has a fiancé already.
      </p>
      <p>
        MASHA. [Raps with her fork on a plate] Let’s all get drunk and make life
        purple for once!
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. You’ve lost three good conduct marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. This is a nice drink. What’s it made of?
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLENI. Blackbeetles.
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. [Tearfully] Phoo! How disgusting!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLGA. There is to be a roast turkey and a sweet apple pie for dinner.
        Thank goodness I can spend all day and the evening at home. You’ll come
        in the evening, ladies and gentlemen....
      </p>
      <p>
        VERSHININ. And please may I come in the evening!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. Please do.
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. They don’t stand on ceremony here.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. Nature only brought us into the world that we should love!
        [Laughs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. [Angrily] Please don’t! Aren’t you tired of it?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter FEDOTIK and RODE with a large basket of flowers.]
      </p>
      <p>
        FEDOTIK. They’re lunching already.
      </p>
      <p>
        RODE. [Loudly and thickly] Lunching? Yes, so they are....
      </p>
      <p>
        FEDOTIK. Wait a minute! [Takes a photograph] That’s one. No, just a
        moment.... [Takes another] That’s two. Now we’re ready!
      </p>
      <p>
        [They take the basket and go into the dining-room, where they have a
        noisy reception.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RODE. [Loudly] Congratulations and best wishes! Lovely weather to-day,
        simply perfect. Was out walking with the High School students all the
        morning. I take their drills.
      </p>
      <p>
        FEDOTIK. You may move, Irina Sergeyevna! [Takes a photograph] You look
        well to-day. [Takes a humming-top out of his pocket] Here’s a
        humming-top, by the way. It’s got a lovely note!
      </p>
      <p>
        IRINA. How awfully nice!
      </p>
      MASHA.

        “There stands a green oak by the sea,
        And a chain of bright gold is around it...
        And a chain of bright gold is around it...”
 </pre>
      <p>
        [Tearfully] What am I saying that for? I’ve had those words running in
        my head all day....
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. There are thirteen at table!
      </p>
      <p>
        RODE. [Aloud] Surely you don’t believe in that superstition? [Laughter.]
      </p>
      <p>
        KULIGIN. If there are thirteen at table then it means there are lovers
        present. It isn’t you, Ivan Romanovitch, hang it all.... [Laughter.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHEBUTIKIN. I’m a hardened sinner, but I really don’t see why Natalia
        Ivanovna should blush....
      </p>
      <p>
        [Loud laughter; NATASHA runs out into the sitting-room, followed by
        ANDREY.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. Don’t pay any attention to them! Wait... do stop, please....
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. I’m shy... I don’t know what’s the matter with me and they’re
        all laughing at me. It wasn’t nice of me to leave the table like that,
        but I can’t... I can’t. [Covers her face with her hands.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. My dear, I beg you. I implore you not to excite yourself. I
        assure you they’re only joking, they’re kind people. My dear, good girl,
        they’re all kind and sincere people, and they like both you and me. Come
        here to the window, they can’t see us here.... [Looks round.]
      </p>
      <p>
        NATASHA. I’m so unaccustomed to meeting people!
      </p>
      <p>
        ANDREY. Oh your youth, your splendid, beautiful youth! My darling, don’t
        be so excited! Believe me, believe me... I’m so happy, my soul is full
        of love, of ecstasy.... They don’t see us! They can’t! Why, why or when
        did I fall in love with you—Oh, I can’t understand anything. My
        dear, my pure darling, be my wife! I love you, love you... as never
        before.... [They kiss.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Two officers come in and, seeing the lovers kiss, stop in
        astonishment.]
